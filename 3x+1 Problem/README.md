This project is a stimulation of 3x+1 mathematical problem.

Explanation:

Pick a positive integer. Then repeatedly apply this (rather silly) process:
If your number is even, divide it by 2, and the result becomes your new number. If your number is odd, multiply it by 3, and add 1; that result becomes your new number. Repeat this process until the result is the number 1.

Why stop when the number is 1? Because once you get to 1, you enter a loop. Try it: 1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 ->...  Hopefully, you get the idea.

You might wonder why we are even bothering to discuss this little process. It turns out to have a rather interesting history in the study of mathematics. Every positive integer that anyone has ever tried always ends up at the number 1. Always. However, no one has ever PROVEN that no matter what positive integer you choose, you will always finish in that 1,4,2,1 loop. Many mathematicians have TRIED to prove it, but (at least so far) to no avail.
