          <p>This algorithm covers how to find a chord of an unknown length within a circular plane. It also covers how to find a chord within a circular plane that is perpendicular to the origin of the circle. This algorithm makes up the basis for how the new diameter is determined for the dart board after each throw.</p>

          <p>This section covers the second main algorithm in this application. This algorithm is designed to determine or estimate what the most likely possible score is for a game of darts where the board keeps shrinking based on the distance from the origin of your throw. This algorithm relies on the first algorithm to determine what the new diameter will be after each throw.</p>

          <p>Hey, I get it, you've seen all the algorithms that you want to see, and you've learned everything that you can or wish to from this application. Now, it's time to apply these two algorithms as you begin a game of darts. This game will incorporate our aforementioned algorithms as the board shrinks to match the chord of your throws.</p>
